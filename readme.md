## Arduino Based Light Switch Operator
This is a device that may be useful for solving the problem of reducing electricity usage. Even though we think that electricity is a clean alternative to fuel vehicles, we often tend to forget that electricity in our country, is still mostly generated by burning charcoal, which makes electricity just as bad as other fuels, just affordable compared to them. 
So, to reduce the usage of this electricity, I have created this project, which is based on Arduino, has components like a servo, and ultrasonic distance sensor

## Features

- **Arduino-based**: Utilizes an Arduino microcontroller for operation.
- **Servo Motor**: Controls the physical switch mechanism.
- **Ultrasonic Distance Sensor**: Detects the presence of a person to automate the switch.
- **Energy Efficient**: Helps in reducing unnecessary electricity usage.

## Components

- Arduino Uno
- Servo Motor
- Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
- Power Supply

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/advaitmuley/Arduino-Based-Light-Switch-Operator.git
    ```
2. **Upload the code to Arduino**:
    - Open the Arduino IDE.
    - Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
    - Open the `.ino` file from the cloned repository.
    - Select the correct board and port from the Tools menu.
    - Click on the Upload button.

## Usage

1. **Connect the components** as per the circuit diagram provided in the repository.
2. **Power the Arduino** using a suitable power supply.
3. **Place the device** near the light switch you want to control.
4. **Adjust the servo motor** to align with the switch mechanism.
5. **Test the setup** by moving your hand in front of the ultrasonic sensor to see if the servo motor operates the switch.
